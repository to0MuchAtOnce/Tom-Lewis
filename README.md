# Portfolio Site

## What I want to achive

I made this site to display my skills as I develop as a web developer. Here's a list of things I plan to achive over the coming months:

- Keep my blog up to date, writing posts about things I work on.
- Display my projects as I make them.
- Showcase my photography work.

## Ingredients

- Next.js v.12
- TypeScript v.4
- Styled Components v.5
- Styled Icons (Material) v.10

## Interested in how it works?

1. Clone the site:

2. Run

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open in the browser at http://localhost:3000
