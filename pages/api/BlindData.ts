      'I found myself it a tough place during lockdown from October 2021. I was living alone, my partner having moved back to here home country to be closer to her family, I lost contact with a good friend, and I lost most of my work. Suddenly my routine was gone, and I found myself lacking direction and quickly approaching collapse both mentally, and physically. Looking back on this time now, I have fond memories. Yes it was difficult, but the lessons I learned from it all are more valuable than the years of stability I’d previously enjoyed. I didn’t imagine I’d learn to play chess, or pursue an interest in web development. Both of these interests I still strongly pursue today.',

A series of photos which for me capture the essence of what I was going through at the time. I posted 1 image a week for 11 weeks, and the rules I set myself were that the photos had to be blurred, and I had to wear a blindfold while taking them. This enabled me to get creative in the small space I was confined to for most of those days.',
